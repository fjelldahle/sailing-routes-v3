## 1. Bareboat Charter Prices (40-45ft Monohull, Late April)

Late April is still considered "low/shoulder season" in Greece, which means significantly better pricing compared to July-August peak rates.

**Typical weekly rates for a 40-45ft monohull, April 2026:**

| Company / Model | Weekly Rate | 2-Week Estimate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Navigare Yachting (44-46ft monohull) | ~EUR 1,500-1,700/week | EUR 3,000-3,400 | Athens base, 10-15% early booking discount possible |
| Istion Yachting (Hanse 418, 41ft) | ~EUR 1,950-2,100/week | EUR 3,900-4,200 | Lavrion or Alimos base |
| Sunsail 41.0 Classic (41ft) | ~USD 2,599/week (~EUR 2,400) | EUR 4,800 | Zea Marina (Piraeus) |
| Sunsail 404 Classic (40ft) | ~USD 3,999/week (~EUR 3,700) | EUR 7,400 | Zea Marina (Piraeus) |
| Sunsail Oceanis 46.1 (46ft) | ~USD 4,099/week (~EUR 3,800) | EUR 7,600 | Zea Marina (Piraeus) |
| General market range | EUR 1,200-2,500/week | EUR 2,400-5,000 | Varies by age, model, company |

**Bottom line:** For a well-maintained 40-42ft monohull (e.g., Beneteau Oceanis 40.1, Jeanneau Sun Odyssey 410, Hanse 418), expect EUR 1,500-2,500 per week in late April. Two weeks total: **EUR 3,000-5,000 for the boat charter alone.** Local Greek companies (Istion, Olympic, Kavas) tend to be 20-40% cheaper than international brands (Sunsail, Moorings).

Popular models in this size range available in Athens: Bavaria 46 Cruiser, Beneteau Oceanis 40.1, Beneteau Oceanis 46.1, Jeanneau Sun Odyssey 410, Jeanneau Sun Odyssey 440, Hanse 418.

## 5. Marina Fees / Mooring Costs Per Night

Greece is one of the most affordable Mediterranean sailing destinations for moorings.

### Marina Pricing (Full-Service Marinas)
- **Major marinas** (Alimos, Zea, large island marinas): EUR 50-70/night for 40-45ft
- **Mid-tier marinas:** EUR 20-30/night
- **Small town quays:** EUR 6-20/night

### Specific Examples
| Location | Cost/Night | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Naxos | ~EUR 15 | Includes water and power |
| Kythnos (Loutra) | ~EUR 6 | Town quay |
| Syros (Foinikas) | ~EUR 6 | Town quay |
| Fiscardo | EUR 20-30 | Popular stop |
| Poros (South quay) | ~EUR 7 | Mooring |
| Average town quay (40ft) | ~EUR 20 | General estimate |

### Free Anchoring
Many bays in Greece allow free anchoring. In the Cyclades and Saronic, you can anchor for free in numerous sheltered bays, dramatically reducing mooring costs.

### 2-Week Mooring Estimate
Assuming a mix of marinas, town quays, and free anchoring:
- **Budget (mostly anchoring):** EUR 100-200
- **Moderate (mix):** EUR 200-400
- **Marina-heavy:** EUR 400-700

## 6. One-Way Fees

If you want to end your charter in a different port than where you started:

- **Flat fee range:** EUR 800-1,450, depending on distance
- **Per-nautical-mile rate:** Some companies charge EUR 5.00/nautical mile between home port and disembarkation port
- **Example:** Lavrion to Santorini (~120 NM) could be EUR 600-1,450
- **Includes:** Fuel for the delivery trip + lost charter days as the boat is repositioned

**Important:** Not all companies offer one-way charters. It's more common with larger operators (Sunsail, Moorings, Dream Yacht Charter). Local companies generally require round-trip returns. One-way options are more limited in April (early season).

**Recommendation:** Plan a round-trip itinerary. With 2 weeks, you can easily reach the Cyclades from Lavrion and return, or do a comprehensive Saronic Gulf circuit.

## 7. Deposit Amounts

### Security Deposit (Refundable)
| Boat Size | Typical Deposit |
|---|---|
| 40ft monohull | EUR 2,000-3,000 |
| 45ft monohull | EUR 2,500-4,000 |
| Catamaran | EUR 3,000-5,000 |

- Paid at check-in via credit card (pre-authorization) or cash
- Returned in full at end of charter if no damage/loss
- Covers the insurance deductible ("excess")

### Deposit Waiver / Reduction Options
- **Damage waiver fee:** ~EUR 200-350/week (non-refundable) reduces deposit to EUR 500-600
- **Third-party deposit insurance:** 7-15% of deposit amount (e.g., EUR 225 covers up to EUR 2,500 deposit, EUR 360 covers EUR 4,000)
- **Example:** Pay EUR 225 insurance premium, and if something happens, the insurance covers the deposit instead of you

**Recommendation:** The deposit waiver/insurance is generally worth it for peace of mind. A EUR 200-350 non-refundable fee to reduce a EUR 3,000 deposit to EUR 500 is good value.

---

### Included with Charter
- All charter boats come with **mandatory third-party liability insurance** (required by Greek law)
- Typical coverage: up to EUR 500,000 for damages or personal accidents

## 9. Best Departure Marina Comparison

### Lavrion (Olympic Marine)

| Factor | Details |
|---|---|
| **Distance from airport** | ~30 min drive (closest to ATH) |
| **Best for** | Cyclades sailing (Kea is ~2h sail away) |
| **Sailing conditions** | More exposed to Aegean winds, better for experienced sailors |
| **Atmosphere** | Quiet, traditional, slower pace |
| **Fleet** | Olympic Yachting, Istion, ARCHON, Dream Yacht Charter |
| **Facilities** | Good but less extensive than Alimos |
| **Provisioning nearby** | Supermarkets in town, less choice than Athens |

### Alimos Marina (Kalamaki)

| Factor | Details |
|---|---|
| **Distance from airport** | ~45-60 min drive |
| **Best for** | Saronic Gulf (Aegina ~16 NM, Poros, Hydra) + Cyclades possible |
| **Sailing conditions** | Saronic is calm and sheltered, beginner-friendly |
| **Atmosphere** | Cosmopolitan, seaside promenade, lively nightlife |
| **Fleet** | Istion (main base), Kavas, many operators |
| **Facilities** | 1,000+ berths, largest marina in Greece, full services |

### Zea Marina (Piraeus)

| Factor | Details |
|---|---|
| **Distance from airport** | ~60 min drive |
| **Best for** | Access to both Saronic and Cyclades |

**For Saronic Gulf:** Alimos or Zea. Calm waters, close island-hopping.

**For mixed itinerary (best for 2 weeks):** Lavrion. Head south to Kea/Kythnos/Syros, then loop back. Or sail the "milk run" through the western Cyclades.

**For convenience and provisioning:** Alimos or Zea if you want to spend a day in Athens before departure.

**No COVID entry restrictions remain.** No vaccination certificate, recovery certificate, or negative test required for entry to Greece as of 2025/2026.

- **Full operation expected from April 10, 2026** -- just 8 days before your departure
- Non-EU citizens will need to register biometric details (fingerprints, photo) when entering the Schengen area
- No cost for registration
- **This is new and may cause initial delays at borders in mid-April 2026**

### Sailing-Specific Requirements
1. **DEKPA** (Private Pleasure Maritime Traffic Document): EUR 30, 6-page booklet stamped at each port visited. Charter company usually arranges this.
2. **Crew list:** Passport numbers and dates of birth for all crew, presented to port police.
3. **Insurance certificate:** Greek-language third-party liability insurance (charter company provides).
4. **Cruising tax (E-TEPAI):** Payable for all vessels over 7m in Greek waters:

   - 8m-10m: EUR 300
   - 10m-12m: EUR 400

5. **Port police check-in:** Present yacht registration, insurance certificate, and crew list at first port.

### Important Note on E-TEPAI
The cruising tax applies to vessel owners. For bareboat charters, **most charter companies include this in the charter fee or handle payment themselves.** Verify with your charter company whether it's included or an additional charge.

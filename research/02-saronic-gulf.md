# Sailing Route: Saronic Gulf & Eastern Peloponnese

**Athens (Alimos Marina) -- April 18 to May 2, 2026 -- 14 days / 13 nights**

---

## 1. Why This Route Is Perfect for Less Experienced Sailors

The Saronic Gulf is widely regarded as **the best sailing ground in Greece for beginners**, and here is why:

- **Sheltered waters.** The gulf sits between the Attica peninsula and the Peloponnese, shielding it from the open Aegean. Unlike the Cyclades, there are **no Meltemi winds** here -- the strong summer northerlies that hammer open-water routes simply do not penetrate the Saronic.
- **Short hops.** Most legs are 10-25 NM, meaning 2-4 hours of sailing per day. If conditions change, you are never far from shelter.
- **Predictable conditions.** In late April, expect Force 3-5 (10-20 knots), predominantly from the south/southwest. Seas rarely exceed 1-2 meters. Gusts above 25 knots are uncommon.
- **Abundant harbors.** Unlike remote cruising grounds, there is a port, marina, or protected anchorage every few miles along the coast.
- **No open-sea crossings.** The longest leg on this route (Spetses to Monemvasia, ~36 NM) stays within sight of the Peloponnese coast the entire way.

## 2. Late April Weather -- Specific Data

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Air temp (high)** | 19-22 C |
| **Air temp (low)** | 13-15 C |
| **Sea temperature** | 16 C (wetsuits for swimming) |
| **Wind** | Force 3-5 (10-20 knots), predominantly S/SW |
| **Rainfall** | ~35 mm total for April, ~5 rainy days |
| **Sunshine** | ~8 hours/day (240 hrs/month) |
| **Sea state** | Calm to moderate, waves rarely >1-2 m |
| **Daylight** | ~13.5 hours (sunrise ~06:45, sunset ~20:15) |

**Late April specifically** is the sweet spot: warmer than early April, drier, longer days, and before the summer crowds arrive. Tourist infrastructure is open but not overwhelmed. You will have harbors largely to yourselves.

## 3. Day-by-Day Itinerary

### Day 1 (April 18) -- Athens to Aegina

---

### Day 3 (April 20) -- Agistri to Epidavros (Palaia Epidavros)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Distance** | ~15 NM (via the channel between Aegina and Angistri, across to the Peloponnese coast) |
| **Sailing time** | ~3 hours |

**Attractions:**
- **Ancient Theatre of Epidaurus** (30 min by taxi/bus from the port) -- seats 14,000, acoustics so perfect you can hear a coin drop from the top row. UNESCO World Heritage Site. This alone justifies the stop.
- The Sanctuary of Asklepios (ancient healing center)
- Small archaeological museum
- The village of Palaia Epidavros itself is charming and quiet

**Food:** Waterfront tavernas in Palaia Epidavros village. Fresh fish, simple Greek cooking. Try the local orange groves' produce.

---

### Day 4 (April 21) -- Epidavros to Nafplio

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Distance** | ~15 NM (along the Argolic Gulf coast) |

**Pro tip:** Nafplio deserves a full day. Consider staying two nights if the crew wants to explore properly.

---

### Day 5 (April 22) -- Nafplio rest day / explore

Stay in Nafplio. Visit Palamidi in the morning (cooler), wander the old town, optional day trip to Mycenae (30 min by taxi, the legendary citadel of Agamemnon) or Nemea wine region for tastings.

---

### Day 6 (April 23) -- Nafplio to Porto Heli

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Distance** | 25 NM |

---

### Day 7 (April 24) -- Porto Heli to Spetses

|--------|------|
| **Distance** | ~6 NM |
| **Sailing time** | ~1-1.5 hours |

**Anchorage:** **Baltiza (Old Harbor)** is the main yacht harbor on the SE side of town -- 55m pier, 7m draught, but often crowded even in April. Dapia (the main port) works for a short stop but is exposed. Alternative: anchor off Xilokeriza beach or Agia Paraskevi on the south coast.

**Attractions:**
- **No cars** -- like Hydra, but with horse-drawn carriages and vintage motorcycles instead
- Elegant neoclassical mansions lining the waterfront
- **Bouboulina Museum** (heroine of Greek independence, her actual house)
- Annual Armata festival reenacts a naval battle (September, but the harbor setup is visible)

---

### Day 8 (April 25) -- Spetses to Leonidio (Plaka)

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Distance** | ~23 NM (south along the Peloponnese coast) |
| **Sailing time** | ~4-5 hours |

**Anchorage:** Small harbor at Plaka (the port of Leonidio), 4 km from the town. Sheltered, quiet, good holding.

**Attractions:**
- **Dramatic red cliffs** rising above the village -- one of the most spectacular approaches by sea on the route
- World-class rock climbing destination (if anyone in the crew climbs)
- **Monastery of Panagia Elona** -- perched impossibly high on a cliff face
- 19th-century neoclassical mansions in Leonidio town
- Tsakonian dialect (oldest surviving Greek dialect, still spoken here)

**Food:** Waterfront tavernas in Plaka -- simple, traditional, fresh. The Tsakonian eggplant is a local specialty (there is literally a festival for it in August).

---

### Day 9 (April 26) -- Leonidio to Monemvasia

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Distance** | ~33 NM (this is the longest leg; can be broken at Kiparissi if needed -- 20 NM + 13 NM) |
| **Sailing time** | ~5-7 hours direct |

**Option to split:** Stop at **Kiparissi** (20 NM from Leonidio) -- a hidden, fjord-like bay with three tiny villages, dramatic cliffs, and almost no tourists. Excellent overnight anchorage. Then 13 NM to Monemvasia the next day.

**Anchorage at Monemvasia:** Anchor north of the causeway (50-70m from the small dock), or use the new small marina. Good holding in sand. The approach is straightforward but watch for gusts if northerlies are blowing.

**Attractions:**

**This is the signature stop of the trip.** Allow a full day minimum.

---

### Day 10 (April 27) -- Monemvasia rest day

Stay in Monemvasia. Walk the upper town ruins in the morning. Wine tasting. Swim off the rocks below the fortress walls. This place deserves unhurried time.

---

### Day 11 (April 28) -- Monemvasia to Ermioni

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Distance** | ~41 NM (the second longest leg; return northward) |
| **Sailing time** | ~6-8 hours |

**Alternative:** Break this at Porto Heli (similar distance pattern) or Spetses. But with good April winds from the south, this is a fantastic downwind/beam reach sail back up the Peloponnese coast.

**Anchorage:** Ermioni harbor has all-around shelter in a deep, wooded bay. Anchor off the south side (room for 20-30 yachts, prettier than the north side). Marina Ermioni has ~130 serviced berths with full facilities. Waterfront taverna owners often help with mooring and provide electricity/water/wifi if you eat with them.

**Attractions:**
- Quiet, authentic fishing town -- no cruise ships, no mass tourism
- Pine-forested peninsula walk
- Swimming off the rocks
- Local honey and olive oil

**Food:** Waterfront tavernas along the harbor -- fresh fish, slow pace.

---

### Day 12 (April 29) -- Ermioni to Hydra

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Distance** | ~10 NM |
| **Sailing time** | ~2 hours |

**Anchorage:** Hydra's harbor is tiny and famous for being packed in summer, but **late April is ideal** -- you will likely find space stern-to on the quay (~20 EUR/night). Arrive before noon to be safe. If full, alternatives:
- **Mandraki** (1 NM east) -- attractive anchorage, 3-6m depth, sand/weed/mud, water taxi to town
- **Molos** (few miles west) -- isolated, peaceful

**Attractions:**
- **Absolutely no motorized vehicles** -- no cars, no motorbikes, no scooters. Transport is by donkey, water taxi, or on foot. This is Hydra's defining feature and it creates a magical atmosphere.
- Stone mansions cascading down to the harbor -- one of the most photographed harbors in Greece
- **Leonard Cohen lived here** (1960s) -- his house is on the hill above the port
- Art galleries and the Hydra Museum of Historical Archives
- Swimming from rocks at Spilia and Hydronetta (sunset swimming spot with a bar)
- Hike to Profitis Ilias monastery (1 hour, panoramic views)

**Food:**
- **Omilos** -- right on the harbor, upscale but good
- **Kodylenia's** -- traditional taverna in the back streets
- Waterfront cafes for people-watching

**Hydra is the jewel of the Saronic.** The no-car rule, the architecture, the light, the sound of donkey hooves on cobblestones -- it is genuinely unlike anywhere else.

---

### Day 13 (April 30) -- Hydra to Poros

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Distance** | 12 NM |
| **Sailing time** | ~2-3 hours |

**Anchorage/Marina:** Poros Town quay (stern-to along the waterfront) or **Poros Marina** (well-sheltered, water/electricity, good facilities). Russian Bay on the north shore is a beautiful natural anchorage for a lunch stop. The 200m-wide channel between Poros and the Peloponnese mainland creates an almost river-like setting.

- The entire waterfront is lined with restaurants -- stroll and pick

---

### Day 14 (May 1) -- Poros to Methana (optional) to Alimos

| Detail | Info |
|--------|------|
| **Distance** | Poros to Methana: 6 NM; Methana to Alimos: ~24 NM. Or Poros direct to Alimos: ~30 NM |
| **Sailing time** | 5-6 hours total |

**Option A -- Quick stop at Methana:**
- Volcanic peninsula with **hot springs** (thermal baths dating to antiquity)

## 7. Practical Tips

- **Charter base:** Alimos Marina (Marina Kalamaki) is the largest charter base near Athens. Alternatives: Marina Zea in Piraeus or Lavrion.
- **Provisioning:** Stock up fully in Athens/Aegina. Smaller islands have basic shops but limited selection.
- **Water:** Fill tanks at every opportunity. Some anchorages have no water supply.
- **April evenings are cool** (13-15 C) -- bring layers, a fleece, and a light waterproof jacket.
- **Sea swimming in late April:** Refreshing (16 C). Wetsuits recommended for extended swims. By May it warms to 18-19 C.
- **Arrive early at popular harbors** -- Hydra and Spetses can fill up even in shoulder season on weekends (Greek domestic visitors).

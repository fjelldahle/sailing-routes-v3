# Ionian Islands: 14-Day Sailing Route (April 18 - May 2)

## Lefkas Marina -- South to Zakynthos -- and Back

---

## 1. RECOMMENDED ITINERARY: Day-by-Day

The route forms a loop south from Lefkas to Zakynthos and back, with time built in for rest days and exploring. Total estimated distance: **~200 nautical miles** for the full circuit.

### WEEK 1: Southbound (Lefkas to Zakynthos)

**Day 1 (Apr 18) -- Lefkas Marina to Sivota, Lefkas**
- Distance: ~15 NM | Sailing time: ~3 hours
- Head south through the Lefkas Canal. Sivota is one of the largest natural coves in the Ionian chain and offers excellent shelter. The hillsides are green and steep, the water clear.
- **Anchorage:** Stern-to on the quay or anchor in the bay. Well-protected from all directions.
- **Food:** Family-run tavernas line the waterfront. "12 Gods Taverna" is the standout. Stavros taverna has its own pontoon and a terrace with sunset views. Fresh lobster is the local specialty.
- **Highlights:** Swim in turquoise water, paddleboard, dinghy ashore for sunset drinks.

**Day 2 (Apr 19) -- Sivota to Meganisi (Spartochori/Port Atheni)**
- Distance: ~11 NM | Sailing time: ~2.5 hours
- Short sail to one of the most charming small islands in the Ionian. Fewer than 1,000 permanent residents. Crystal-clear water, sea caves, hidden coves.
- **Anchorages:** Port Atheni (5-6m depth, good holding, great swimming), Abelike Bay (calm, sheltered, ideal overnight), or Port Spilia beneath Spartochori village.
- **Food:** Spilia Taverna in Port Spilia (good value). Niagas and Atherinos tavernas in Vathi for traditional Greek specialties. Fresh bread from Katomeri village (30 min walk from Port Atheni).
- **Highlights:** Hike up to Spartochori for panoramic views over the harbor and Skorpios island (the Onassis family island). Visit Papanikolis Cave by dinghy -- a WWII submarine hiding spot.

**Day 3 (Apr 20) -- Meganisi to Kastos**
- Distance: ~10 NM | Sailing time: ~2 hours
- Tiny island, population under 50. This is the smallest inhabited Ionian island. Completely off the tourist radar.
- **Anchorage:** Sarakiniko Bay (room to swing, few boats) or Kastos harbour for shelter.
- **Food:** Very limited -- one or two seasonal tavernas. Bring provisions from Meganisi.
- **Highlights:** Crystal-clear snorkeling, empty beaches, total peace. Nearby Formikoula islands have an underwater swim-through tunnel and excellent marine life.

**Day 4 (Apr 21) -- Kastos to Ithaca (Vathi)**
- Distance: ~19 NM | Sailing time: ~4 hours
- Sail to the legendary home of Odysseus. Vathi is a deep natural harbor, sheltered and beautiful, set in a dramatic fjord-like inlet.
- **Anchorage:** Vathi port -- excellent protection from all winds except NW gusts. Extensive quay space for stern-to mooring.
- **Food:** Numerous tavernas in Vathi town. Fresh fish, moussaka, local wine. Good provisioning -- supermarkets, bakeries, butcher.
- **Highlights:** Archaeological Museum of Ithaca, the Cave of the Nymphs (where Odysseus allegedly hid his treasure). Walk to Polis Bay, believed to be the site of Odysseus's palace. The harbor at night is atmospheric and quiet.

**Day 5 (Apr 22) -- Ithaca: Vathi to Kioni (day hop)**
- Distance: ~14 NM | Sailing time: ~3 hours
- Sail north along Ithaca's coast to one of the prettiest harbors in the entire Ionian. Stop en route at Gidaki Bay (crystal-clear water, underwater caves, great snorkeling) or Filiatro Bay (white pebble beach).
- **Anchorage:** Kioni quay (stern-to or longlined to cliffs). Arrive early -- afternoon NW gusts make mooring trickier. Small harbor, fills up fast even in shoulder season.
- **Food:** Waterfront tavernas with tables right by the water. Classic Greek island dining -- grilled octopus, fresh salads, local wines.
- **Highlights:** Kioni is a postcard village: stone houses, cypress trees, tiny harbor. Walk the coastal path. No cars in the village center. One of the most photographed spots in the Ionian.

**Day 6 (Apr 23) -- Kioni to Fiskardo, Kefalonia**
- Distance: ~16 NM | Sailing time: ~3.5 hours
- Cross the strait to the northern tip of Kefalonia. Fiskardo is the only village on Kefalonia that survived the devastating 1953 earthquake, so it retains its original Venetian architecture.
- **Anchorage:** Fiskardo harbour (stern-to on the quay). Safe and picturesque. Can be crowded in summer but April should be manageable.
- **Food:** The best dining scene on Kefalonia. Upscale waterfront restaurants alongside traditional tavernas. Fresh seafood is exceptional.
- **Highlights:** 18th-century Venetian pastel-colored houses, boutique shopping, the lighthouse walk. Snorkel at Emblisi Beach (just north of harbor). Fiskardo feels like a mini Portofino.

**Day 7 (Apr 24) -- Fiskardo to Agia Efimia, Kefalonia**
- Distance: ~15 NM | Sailing time: ~3 hours
- Sail south along Kefalonia's east coast. Agia Efimia is a small, authentic harbor town -- the gateway to Kefalonia's natural wonders.
- **Anchorage:** Agia Efimia harbour, good shelter.
- **Food:** Fewer tourists than Fiskardo, more authentic tavernas. Try the local Robola wine (Kefalonia's own grape variety).
- **Highlights:** This is the base for visiting **Melissani Cave** -- a collapsed cave with an underground turquoise lake. Visit mid-afternoon when sunlight floods through the opening and the water glows an unreal blue. Also nearby: Drogarati Cave (stalactites, good acoustics). Both are a short taxi/bus ride from the harbor.

---

### WEEK 2: Zakynthos and Return North

**Day 8 (Apr 25) -- Agia Efimia to Zakynthos Town (via Poros)**
- Distance: ~30-35 NM | Sailing time: ~6-7 hours
- The longest leg of the trip. Sail south down Kefalonia's east coast, past Sami and Poros, then across to Zakynthos. This is open water sailing between the islands -- the most exposed stretch of the route.
- **Anchorage:** Zakynthos Town port (rebuilt after 1953 earthquake, Venetian-style). Only 2 yacht marinas on the whole island, so plan ahead.
- **Food:** The town has a lively waterfront with restaurants and bars. Try local specialties: mandolato (nougat), pasteli (sesame bars), and fresh fish.
- **Highlights:** Zakynthos Town has a Venetian castle (Bohali Castle) above the harbor with panoramic views. The Church of St. Dionysios. Lively evening atmosphere.

**Day 9 (Apr 26) -- Zakynthos: Rest Day / Explore**
- Stay in Zakynthos. Rent a car or scooter to see the island's highlights that cannot be reached by boat from the east side.
- **Highlights:** **Navagio (Shipwreck Beach)** -- the most photographed beach in Greece. Only accessible by boat (take a local tour boat from the north coast, or sail around if conditions allow -- exposed to westerly swell). **Blue Caves** on the northern tip -- mesmerizing blue light reflected from mineral deposits. **Laganas Bay** in the south -- nesting ground for Loggerhead (Caretta Caretta) sea turtles (a national marine park). The turtles are active from May onward, so late April is borderline for sightings.
- **Food:** Kalas restaurant in town for traditional Zakynthian cuisine. Strada Marina area for waterfront dining.

**Day 10 (Apr 27) -- Zakynthos to Poros, Kefalonia**
- Distance: ~22 NM | Sailing time: ~4-5 hours
- Head back north. Poros is a small harbor on Kefalonia's southeast corner -- a convenient waypoint on the return leg.
- **Anchorage:** Poros harbour. Modest facilities but good shelter.
- **Food:** Simple tavernas, authentic atmosphere.
- **Highlights:** Walk to nearby beaches. This is "real" Kefalonia -- no cruise ships, no tour buses.

**Day 11 (Apr 28) -- Poros to Vathi, Ithaca**
- Distance: ~20 NM | Sailing time: ~4 hours
- Return to Ithaca. If you want variety, anchor in a different bay this time -- try Aetos Bay or Frikes on the north coast.
- **Anchorage:** Frikes (if not visited yet) or return to Vathi.
- **Food:** Frikes has a handful of excellent waterfront tavernas.
- **Highlights:** Frikes is smaller and quieter than Kioni -- a fishing village atmosphere. Good for a quiet overnight.

**Day 12 (Apr 29) -- Ithaca to Kalamos**
- Distance: ~20 NM | Sailing time: ~4 hours
- Head northeast to Kalamos, a mountainous island rising 754m from the sea. Densely forested, spectacularly wild.
- **Anchorage:** Port Kalamos (well sheltered, can be busy in bad weather). Or anchor at Episkopi on the north coast for total isolation.
- **Food:** Taverna at Episkopi fishing village (when open). Port Kalamos has a couple of seasonal tavernas. Provisions are limited -- stock up before arriving.
- **Highlights:** Port Leone -- a deserted village abandoned after the 1953 earthquake. Hauntingly beautiful for exploring. Asprogiali Beach on the northeast -- crystal-clear water, excellent snorkeling. The island feels wild and untouched.

**Day 13 (Apr 30) -- Kalamos to Nidri, Lefkas**
- Distance: ~12 NM | Sailing time: ~2.5 hours
- Short sail back toward Lefkas. Nidri is the watersports and sailing hub of Lefkas, with excellent facilities and a lively waterfront.
- **Anchorage:** Nidri quay or anchor in Tranquil Bay (Desimi Bay) just south of town.
- **Food:** Wide selection of restaurants and bars in Nidri. Good provisioning for the last night.
- **Highlights:** Views across to Skorpios and Meganisi. Nidri waterfall (a short walk from town). Last chance for shopping and souvenirs.

**Day 14 (May 1) -- Nidri to Lefkas Marina**
- Distance: ~10 NM | Sailing time: ~2 hours
- Easy final sail back to Lefkas Marina. Arrive by midday to refuel, clean up, and prepare for handback.
- **Highlights:** Lefkas town is worth exploring -- the colorful corrugated-iron buildings (earthquake-proof architecture), the swing bridge, and the lively central square.

**Day 15 (May 2) -- Disembark Lefkas Marina**
- Charter handover morning.

## 3. WHY THE IONIAN IS DIFFERENT FROM THE AEGEAN

### Wind
The Ionian has the "thermal breeze" pattern: **calm mornings, wind picking up to Force 3-4 (10-16 knots) by 2-3pm, dying off by evening.** Rarely exceeds 20 knots. The Aegean, by contrast, is dominated by the **Meltemi** -- a northern wind that can blast Force 6-7 (25-35 knots) for 3-4 days straight in summer. The Meltemi makes Aegean sailing exhilarating but challenging; the Ionian is gentler and more predictable.

### Landscape
The Ionian is **green**. Emerald hills, olive groves, cypress forests, lush vegetation cascading down to turquoise water. The Aegean (Cyclades, Dodecanese) is arid, rocky, and white-washed -- beautiful in a stark, dramatic way, but completely different character. The Ionian's flora slows land heating, which is partly why there is less thermal wind.

### Water
Aegean = deep blue. Ionian = **turquoise and emerald green**, with extraordinary clarity. The color difference is striking.

### Culture and Architecture
The Ionian Islands were never under Ottoman rule. Instead, they were governed by **Venice for over 400 years (14th-18th century)**, then briefly by France, Russia, and Britain. This gives them a distinctly **Italian/Western European** character: Venetian architecture, Italian-influenced cuisine, cantada music traditions, and legal systems based on Roman/Venetian codes. Pastel-colored buildings, colonnaded streets, and Italian loanwords in the local dialect. The Aegean islands have a more classically "Greek" identity -- white-and-blue Cycladic architecture, Ottoman historical influences, and a different culinary tradition.

### Sailing Character
Ionian: **sheltered, short hops, numerous coves, lazy pace.** You motor in the morning, sail in the afternoon, anchor in a protected bay by evening. Aegean: **open water, longer passages, more committed sailing, bigger seas.** The Ionian is a "one anchorage per hour" kind of place; the Aegean can mean 6-8 hour passages between islands.

## 4. WEATHER: Late April in the Ionian

| Factor | Conditions |
|--------|-----------|
| **Air temperature** | 18-24C daytime, 12-15C at night |
| **Sea temperature** | 16-18C -- swimmable for the brave, brisk for most. No wetsuit needed for quick dips, but extended swimming is chilly |
| **Wind** | Variable and lighter than summer. 6-15 knots typical. More variable direction than the steady NW summer pattern. Some days flat calm (you will motor), some days pleasant sailing breeze |
| **Rain** | Possible -- April is the tail end of the rainy season. Expect 4-6 rainy days across 2 weeks, usually short showers rather than all-day rain. Rain clears quickly |
| **Daylight** | ~13.5 hours. Sunrise ~6:40, sunset ~20:10 |
| **Crowds** | Minimal. This is pre-season. Harbors will be nearly empty. Some tavernas may not yet be open on smaller islands -- check ahead for Kastos and Kalamos |

**April verdict:** Excellent for sailing, slightly cool for swimming. The tradeoff for cooler water is empty anchorages, lower prices, green landscapes (everything blooms in spring), and an authentic atmosphere before the charter fleets arrive in May. Bring layers for evenings and a light rain jacket.

## 5. HOW TO GET THERE FROM ATHENS

### Option A: Fly to Preveza/Aktion (RECOMMENDED)
- **Preveza/Aktion Airport (PVK)** is the closest airport to Lefkas Marina, about **20 km / 25 minutes by taxi.**
- **Airlines:** Sky Express and Aegean Airlines operate Athens-Preveza flights. Approximately 11 direct flights per week, though not daily. Flight time ~55 minutes. Some Sky Express flights route through Zakynthos or Corfu.
- **Price:** Approximately 70-140 EUR one way.
- **Taxi from airport to Lefkas Marina:** ~20-30 EUR.
- **Note:** Check flight schedules for April 18 specifically -- not all days have service. Saturday flights are common (charter turnover day), which aligns perfectly with an April 18 Saturday start.

### Option B: Drive/Bus from Athens
- **Driving:** 4.5 hours via the new Ionia Odos motorway (A5). The road is excellent -- modern toll motorway all the way. Cross the Rio-Antirrio bridge (spectacular cable-stayed bridge) and continue north. Lefkada is connected to the mainland by a swing bridge, so no ferry needed.
- **Bus (KTEL):** Departs from Kifisos Bus Station (KTEL) in Athens. ~5 hours. Approximately 40 EUR one way. Modern, comfortable coaches. Runs daily.
- **Private transfer/taxi:** ~440 EUR for a 4-passenger car, ~560 EUR for an 8-passenger van.

### Option C: Sail from Athens via Corinth Canal
- Athens to Corinth Canal: 33 NM. The canal itself is 3.5 NM long, takes ~45 minutes, and is an unforgettable experience (24m wide, sheer rock walls rising 80m on both sides).
- Then through the Gulf of Corinth, past Galaxidi, out through the Patras strait, and up to the Ionian. Total: roughly **180-200 NM** from Athens to Lefkas.
- This would take **3-5 extra days** depending on pace and stops.
- **Verdict:** An adventure in itself, but it eats into your 2-week itinerary significantly. Only worthwhile if you have extra time or are delivering a boat. **For a holiday, fly or drive.**

### Option D: Fly to Corfu + Position South
- Corfu has many more international flights (including direct from Scandinavia, UK, and Europe). You could charter from Corfu and sail south, but this means spending several days getting to the southern Ionian and back, losing time. Better for a North Ionian itinerary (Corfu, Paxos, Antipaxos).

**Recommendation:** Fly Athens to Preveza on the morning of April 18, taxi to Lefkas Marina, board the boat by early afternoon. Reverse on May 2.

---

## 6. TOTAL NAUTICAL MILES

**~217 NM** for the full 14-day circuit as outlined above. This averages to roughly **17 NM per sailing day** (excluding the rest day in Zakynthos), or about **3-4 hours of sailing per day**. The longest single leg is Agia Efimia to Zakynthos at ~33 NM (6-7 hours). All other legs are comfortable half-day sails.

For context: a typical Ionian 1-week charter covers 80-120 NM. Two weeks at ~217 NM is a moderate, comfortable pace that allows for long lunch stops, swimming, and exploring ashore.

## 7. BEST FOR BEGINNERS? FAMILIES?

### Beginners
The Ionian is **widely regarded as the best sailing area in the Mediterranean for beginners.** Reasons:

- **Predictable, light winds** (rarely above 20 knots). The thermal pattern is textbook: calm morning, breeze in the afternoon, calm evening.
- **Short distances between anchorages.** If conditions change, the next sheltered bay is usually under an hour away.
- **Protected waters.** Sailing between the islands and the mainland coast means you are rarely in open sea (except the Zakynthos crossing). Waves are generally small.
- **Numerous charter companies based in Lefkas** offer flotilla holidays (you sail your own boat but with a lead crew that handles navigation briefings, recommends restaurants, and is on radio if you need help). This is an ideal format for first-time bareboat sailors.
- **Minimum qualification:** RYA Day Skipper or ICC (International Certificate of Competence) for bareboat. Alternatively, hire a skipper (typically 150-200 EUR/day) and learn as you go.

### Families
**Excellent for families.** Reasons:

- **Calm conditions** mean less seasickness risk and more comfortable conditions for children.
- **Short sailing days** (2-4 hours) leave plenty of time for swimming, snorkeling, and exploring ashore.
- **Warm, clear water** for swimming (though in late April it will still be cool -- warmer from June onward).
- **Safe anchorages** with beaches accessible by dinghy.
- **Tavernas everywhere** -- Greek food is generally family-friendly, and eating out is affordable.
- **Educational value** -- Ithaca (Odysseus mythology), Venetian history, marine biology (turtle watching in Zakynthos), cave exploration.
- **A catamaran** is strongly recommended for families: more deck space, more stable, separate cabins for kids, and a trampoline net at the bow that children love.

### Charter Costs (April, Shoulder Season)
- **Bareboat monohull (38-42ft):** ~1,500-3,000 EUR/week in April (low season pricing).
- **Bareboat catamaran (40-45ft):** ~2,500-6,000 EUR/week in April.
- **Skippered charter:** Add ~150-200 EUR/day for a professional skipper.
- April is **significantly cheaper** than peak July/August, sometimes 40-50% less.
- Charter operators in Lefkas Marina include Sail Ionian, Nisos Yacht Charter, Ionian Catamarans, Sunsail, Dream Yacht Charter, Istion Yachting, and many others.

## PRACTICAL TIPS

- **Provisioning:** Stock up in Lefkas town or Nidri. Smaller islands (Kastos, Kalamos, Meganisi) have very limited shops. Fiskardo, Vathi (Ithaca), and Zakynthos Town have good supermarkets.
- **Fuel:** Available in Lefkas Marina, Nidri, Fiskardo, Sami, Zakynthos. Plan fuel stops -- some smaller harbors have no fuel.
- **Water:** Fill tanks at every marina opportunity. Water is not always available at smaller quays.
- **April-specific:** Some seasonal tavernas and facilities on smaller islands may not be open yet. The main towns (Fiskardo, Vathi, Zakynthos) will be fully operational.
- **Norwegian localized folders on Google Maps:** "Alle e-post" -- just a note that Greek island names have many spellings (Lefkas/Lefkada, Cephalonia/Kefalonia, Zante/Zakynthos, Ithaki/Ithaca). They are all the same places.

# 2-Week Sailing: The Deep & Small Cyclades
**Athens (Lavrion) -- April 18 to May 2, 2026**

---

## Why These Islands Instead of the "Classic" Cyclades

The classic Cyclades circuit -- Mykonos, Santorini, Paros -- draws millions of visitors and cruise ships annually. The islands on this route represent a fundamentally different Greece:

- **Folegandros** has no airport, which keeps the crowds at bay. Its Chora is considered one of the most exquisite untouched examples of a Cycladic settlement in the entire Aegean.
- **Sikinos** has virtually no tourism infrastructure. A bare, rocky island fringed by sheer cliffs, historically used as a place of exile. Time moves at a visibly slower pace here.
- **Amorgos** gained cult status through Luc Besson's 1988 film *The Big Blue* but remains far enough off the beaten track to feel just a bit more special. The Monastery of Panagia Hozoviotissa, clinging to a 300m cliff, is one of the most dramatic buildings in all of Greece.
- **Koufonisia** (the Small Cyclades) has a permanent population of around 300-400. The largest island can be crossed on foot in 2 hours. Caribbean-quality water, sea caves, and a fishing fleet that feeds the tavernas daily.
- **Anafi** has approximately 270 inhabitants and is seldom visited by yachts. It holds the highest monolith in the eastern Mediterranean (Kalamos, 460m). This is as raw and remote as the Cyclades get.
- **Sifnos** is the gastronomic capital of the Cyclades -- birthplace of Nikolaos Tselementes, Greece's most famous chef. World-class food, excellent anchorages, and a more refined character than its neighbors.

Where Santorini has 2+ million visitors per year, Anafi gets a few thousand. Where Mykonos has all-night clubs, Sikinos has a single taverna serving homemade red wine in its castle. The difference is not subtle.

## The Itinerary: Day by Day

### Day 1 -- April 18 (Saturday): Lavrion to Kythnos (Loutra or Kolona)
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Distance** | ~27 NM |
| **Sailing time** | 4-5 hours |
| **Wind** | Typically light/variable this time of year, 8-12 kt |

**Why stop here:** Kythnos breaks up the long initial passage south and offers excellent shelter. Kolona is a stunning double-sided beach forming a narrow sand isthmus. Loutra has thermal springs right by the harbor.

**Anchorage:** Loutra -- well-protected bay on the NE coast. Alternatively, Kolona bay for a lunch stop (beautiful but less protected). Merihas is the main port if you need provisions.

**Food:** Taverna Katifes in Loutra serves excellent seafood with thermal spring views.

---

### Day 2 -- April 19 (Sunday): Kythnos to Sifnos (Kamares or Vathy)
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Distance** | ~27 NM (to Kamares) |
| **Sailing time** | 4-5 hours |
| **Approach** | Kamares is a deep bay on the west coast, easy approach |

**What makes Sifnos special:** The undisputed food island of the Cyclades. Birthplace of Tselementes (1878-1958), whose name is a synonym for "cookbook" throughout Greece. The island hosts an annual international food festival in his honor. Architecture is among the finest in the Cyclades -- whitewashed villages, blue-domed churches, over 360 churches and monasteries.

**Anchorages:**
- **Kamares (main port):** Room for 3-6 visiting yachts; once the last ferry departs, the Port Police may allow docking alongside the ferry mole. Anchor in the NE corner of the bay at ~5m if berths are full.
- **Vathy (recommended):** The safest anchorage on Sifnos. Anchor off in 3-4m on sand with good holding. Can be gusty in meltemi but provides excellent protection. Beautiful, quiet bay with tavernas ashore. This is where you want to be.

**Food:**
- **Tsikali** (Vathy Beach) -- tables under tamarisk trees, steps from the water, classic Sifnian dishes
- **Cantina** (Seralia, near Kamares) -- award-winning, one of the most important restaurants in the Cyclades
- **Drakakis** (Apollonia) -- proper local favorite, Greek music, endless meze plates
- **Must eat:** Revithada (slow-cooked chickpea stew), mastelo (kid with dill), caper salad, melopita (honey cake)

---

### Day 3 -- April 20 (Monday): Rest Day in Sifnos

Sifnos deserves a full day. Take the bus from Kamares up to Apollonia (the capital), then walk the network of paths between villages. Visit the monastery of Chrissopigi on its own promontory. Swim at Platis Gialos. Eat everywhere.

---

### Day 4 -- April 21 (Tuesday): Sifnos to Folegandros (Karavostasi)
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Distance** | ~26 NM (via Kimolos channel) |
| **Sailing time** | 5-6 hours |
| **Route note** | Pass south of Kimolos/Polyaigos -- spectacular uninhabited coastline worth a lunch stop |

**Optional lunch stop:** Polyaigos -- completely uninhabited island between Kimolos and Folegandros with crystal-clear water. Anchor off the south coast in settled weather.

**What makes Folegandros special:** No airport. That single fact has preserved it. The Chora sits on the edge of a 200m cliff and is genuinely one of the most beautiful villages in Greece -- not in a polished, Instagram way, but in a raw, lived-in way. The medieval Kastro quarter has houses built directly into the fortress walls with their outer walls forming the rampart.

**Anchorage -- Karavostasi:**
- Room for about 6 visiting yachts on the yacht quay
- Approach carefully: avoid the Dhio Adelphia rocks and a rock ~50m east of the mole
- Bottom is sand and rock -- check your anchor is secure before leaving the boat
- **Wind limit:** Port becomes untenable when northerlies exceed 35 knots
- Fierce gusts WNW-NE can terrorize this port -- monitor conditions
- Harbor Master Kostas: +30 697 4362313

**Alternative anchorage -- Vathy (SW coast):**
- Protected from NW-E winds (36.633N, 24.890E)
- Strong meltemi brings violent NE gusts
- Tavernas ashore at Agkali beach

**Food:**
- **Sinadisi** (Ano Meria) -- family-run since 1920, stunning Aegean views, traditional local dishes
- **Blue Cuisine** (Chora entrance) -- cuttlefish risotto, goat with chickpea mash, garden views of the famous church
- **O Kritikos** (Chora main square) -- slow-cooked meat over charcoal, famous Bistecca Folegandrou
- **Must eat:** Matsata (handmade pasta with rabbit), karpouzenia (watermelon pie with honey, cinnamon, sesame)

**Getting to Chora:** 1-hour walk uphill from port, or the island's single taxi.

---

### Day 5 -- April 22 (Wednesday): Folegandros -- Explore / Optional Half-Day

Visit the Chryssospilia (Golden Cave) north of Karavostasi by dinghy -- 4th century BC inscriptions. Walk up to Chora and the Panagia church perched on the cliff above town (sunset here is extraordinary). Visit the Kastro quarter.

**Alternative:** If conditions are perfect, this can become a sailing day instead and you skip the rest day. But Folegandros rewards lingering.

---

### Day 6 -- April 23 (Thursday): Folegandros to Sikinos (Alopronia)
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Distance** | ~10 NM |
| **Sailing time** | 2-3 hours |
| **Character** | Short, easy hop -- the two islands are neighbors |

**What makes Sikinos special:** This is arguably the most untouched inhabited island in the Cyclades. Virtually no tourism infrastructure. A population of around 270. The Chora (divided into Kastro and Chorio) is a genuine working village, not a museum piece. The ancient Temple of Episkopi -- originally a 3rd-century Roman mausoleum later converted to a Byzantine church -- is unique in the Cyclades.

**Anchorage -- Alopronia (only port):**
- Extremely shallow basin; approach with care
- Preferred berth behind ferry quay in SW position, stern-to
- Room for approximately 4 monohulls
- Sandy and rocky bottom, often silted up
- Bus to Chora coordinated with ferry arrivals; 40-min downhill walk back

**Alternative lunch anchorage -- Agios Georgios (SE coast):**
- Very attractive anchorage protected by an islet (36.693N, 25.167E)
- Anchor in 4-6m on solid sand
- Good for lunch stops; mostly solitude
- Open to ENE-SW winds

**Food:**
- **Kapari** (Chora, at the castle entrance) -- delicious food, exceptional homemade red wine, ~25-30 EUR/person
- **Avli** (Alopronia harbor) -- seafood with sea views
- Very few restaurants exist on the island -- this is part of the charm. Food is simple, homemade, and honest.

---

### Day 7 -- April 24 (Friday): Sikinos to Ios (lunch stop) to Amorgos -- Katapola
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Distance** | Sikinos to Ios: ~7 NM; Ios to Katapola: ~28 NM |
| **Total leg** | ~35 NM |
| **Sailing time** | 6-7 hours total (with lunch stop in Ios) |

**Route:** This is the longest passage day. Depart Sikinos early, stop in Ios for lunch (try the protected bay of Tris Klises or Ios port), then continue east to Amorgos. The passage from Ios to Amorgos crosses open water -- expect the wind to build in the afternoon channel between Ios and Amorgos.

**Ios lunch stop:** Ios port is well-protected and has good tavernas. Do not confuse Ios with its party reputation -- in late April, it's quiet and beautiful. The hilltop Chora is a classic Cycladic village.

**Amorgos -- Katapola:**
- Deep bay with excellent protection from northerlies
- Go stern-to on the SW/S quay
- Good amenities, tavernas, provisioning
- **New since 2023: Xilokeratidi North Pier** -- ~9 mooring spots, stern-to, 8-10m depth, electricity and water available. ~10 EUR/night. Ideal in meltemi (wind pushes boat away from pier). Contact Ahmed: +30 2285 071285

**What makes Amorgos special:** The dramatic 17.8 NM-long island with near-vertical 200-650m cliffs on its SE side. Luc Besson filmed *The Big Blue* here in 1988, and the island has attracted a loyal following of divers, hikers, and people seeking something real. The Monastery of Panagia Hozoviotissa (1088 AD), built by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, clings to a 367m cliff face -- 8 floors but only 5m deep. It contains a library of manuscripts and icons.

**Food in Katapola:**
- **Mouragio** -- fish tavern on the main road with port views, seafood delicacies
- **Youkali** -- Mediterranean cuisine: orzo with beetroot, roasted goat, linguini with mussels

---

### Day 8 -- April 25 (Saturday): Rest Day in Amorgos

This is a non-negotiable rest day. Amorgos demands at least a full day ashore.

**Must do:**
- Hike to the Monastery of Hozoviotissa (30 min from Chora -- bring long pants, shoulders covered)
- Walk through Chora: Venetian castle ruins, whitewashed houses, barrel-vaulted churches, windmills
- If ambitious: the 15 km path from Chora to Langada (5+ hours, medium-difficult)

**Food in Chora:**
- **Tranzistoraki** -- family-run, homemade Greek dishes, heart of the old town
- **Botilia** -- wine bar/restaurant with Greek wines, cheese boards, seafood tapas

---

### Day 9 -- April 26 (Sunday): Katapola to Aegiali (optional) or Kalotiri Bay to Koufonisia
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Distance** | Katapola to Aegiali: ~13 NM; Aegiali to Koufonisia: ~16 NM |
| **Alternative** | Katapola directly to Koufonisia: ~16 NM |
| **Sailing time** | 3-5 hours depending on route |

**Option A (recommended if weather allows):** Sail north along the dramatic NW coast of Amorgos to Aegiali. Stop at the Kalotiri Bay anchorage near Nikouria island -- crystal-clear water, one of the safest and most windless places in the Cyclades, protected from the meltemi by Nikouria island. An ideal and peaceful place for a swim. Then continue to Koufonisia in the afternoon.

**Option B:** Sail directly from Katapola to Koufonisia (~16 NM, 3 hours). This gives more time on Koufonisia.

**Kalotiri Bay details:**
- 3 NM west of Aegiali
- 4-8m near beach, 20m mid-bay
- Hard sand with thick weed seabed
- Meltemi-proof; vulnerable to easterlies/southerlies
- Note: Kakopérato channel between Amorgos and Nikouria has minimum 5m depth -- use only in calm conditions on north side

**"Fjord Bay" (Megali Vlichada):**
- Desolate fjord-like scenery on the east coast
- Bow anchor 5-10m coarse sand, second anchor on beach
- Dramatic sudden sunset behind rock face
- Move to Aegiali if winds exceed 35 kt from NNW-NNE

---

### Day 10 -- April 27 (Monday): Koufonisia
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Arrival (if from Day 9)** | Already anchored |
| **Character** | Full exploration day |

**What makes Koufonisia special:** Two islands -- Ano (upper, inhabited, population ~400) and Kato (lower, uninhabited). The entire inhabited island can be walked in 2 hours. The water here is legitimately Caribbean-quality turquoise. Sea caves, natural rock pools, and the sizeable fishing fleet ensures the tavernas serve seafood that was in the water hours earlier.

**Anchorage:**
- Small harbor with fixed lines to the jetty; harbor master directs berths; good shelter in most conditions; water and electricity available
- **Finikas cove** (across from Kato Koufonisi): anchor in 4-5m on sandy bottom; reasonable meltemi shelter but exposed to south

**Must-see beaches and features:**
- **Pori** -- longest beach, 30 min walk from Hora or short boat trip
- **Italida** -- rocky caves, semi-submerged for snorkeling, improbably clear turquoise water
- **Gala** -- a huge hole in the ground containing a beach; name means "milk" from the color of the water inside the cave
- **Kato Koufonisi** (take dinghy or water taxi): Hawaii beach -- turquoise water, golden sand, completely wild
- Natural emerald pool formed among rocks between Platia Pounda and Pori

**Food:**
- **Capetan Nikolas** -- legendary fish tavern right on the water, the most famous on the island. Tables on the dock, catch of the day served hours after it's reeled in
- **Melissa** -- the oldest taverna on the island, excellent goat stew, octopus stifado
- **Mikres Cyclades** -- modern Mediterranean, locally sourced, whitewashed alley in Chora
- **Michalios** -- meat taverna (the only one), owners raise their own livestock on Keros and Kato Koufonisi

---

### Day 11 -- April 28 (Tuesday): Koufonisia to Anafi
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Distance** | ~40 NM (via south of Amorgos and east to Anafi) |
| **Sailing time** | 7-8 hours |
| **Character** | This is the most adventurous leg of the trip |

**IMPORTANT -- WEATHER DECISION POINT:** Anafi is the most exposed and least sheltered stop on this entire route. Its single harbor (Skala Anafi) is open from SW to E, and with meltemi there are strong gusts and very uncomfortable ground swell. **If the forecast shows winds above 20 knots from the north or any significant south component, SKIP Anafi.** See the contingency plan below.

**What makes Anafi special:** With ~270 inhabitants, this is one of the most remote inhabited islands in the Cyclades. The 460m monolith of Kalamos at the eastern end is the highest in the eastern Mediterranean. The monastery of Panagia Kalamiotisa sits atop it, with remains of a temple to Apollo nearby. Roukounas beach has golden sand lined with tamarisks. Anafi was supposedly the island that Apollo raised from the sea to shelter the Argonauts.

**Anchorage -- Skala Anafi (only harbor):**
- (36.346N, 25.772E)
- Open from SW to E -- limited protection
- If no room at the breakwater, anchor off in 3-5m on sand and if possible take a line to the breakwater
- Strong gusts with meltemi; very uncomfortable ground swell possible
- **This harbor does not offer good protection** -- plan your stay around the weather window

**Food:**
- **Margarita's** (Chora) -- homemade pasta, chickpea patties, pies; should be first and last stop
- **Liotrivi** -- traditional fish tavern in an old oil mill, fresh seafood, breathtaking views
- **Roukounas** -- family tavern, fresh fish caught daily by the family's boats, legendary fish soup

---

### Day 12 -- April 29 (Wednesday): Anafi to Santorini/Ios area (transit)
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Distance** | Anafi to Santorini (Vlichada): ~21 NM; or Anafi to Ios: ~35 NM |
| **Sailing time** | 4-6 hours |

**Route choice depends on wind and time:**
- **Option A:** Quick stop at Santorini's south coast (Vlichada marina -- quieter, away from caldera madness), then onward next day.
- **Option B:** Sail direct from Anafi to Ios port (~35 NM), positioning for the return north.

This is a repositioning day -- you are beginning the journey back toward Athens.

---

### Day 13 -- April 30 (Thursday): Transit to Naxos or Paros
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Distance** | Ios to Naxos: ~22 NM; Naxos to Paros: ~17 NM |
| **Sailing time** | 4-5 hours |

Sail from Ios/Santorini area north to Naxos or Paros. Both are large islands with excellent provisioning and well-protected harbors for your last nights. Naoussa on Paros or Naxos town are both excellent overnight stops with plenty of restaurants and shelter.

---

### Day 14 -- May 1 (Friday): Paros/Naxos to Kythnos or Serifos
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Distance** | Paros to Serifos: ~37 NM; Paros to Kythnos: ~45 NM |
| **Sailing time** | 6-8 hours |

Long return leg. Serifos (Livadi bay) is a beautiful stop if time allows -- a less-visited island with an impressive hilltop Chora.

---

### Day 15 -- May 2 (Saturday): Return to Lavrion
| Detail | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Distance** | Kythnos to Lavrion: ~27 NM; Serifos to Lavrion: ~42 NM |
| **Sailing time** | 4-7 hours |

Early departure to arrive by afternoon for charter return.

**Total estimated distance: ~290-340 NM** (depending on routing choices, Anafi inclusion, and return path)

---

## Weather: Late April in the Cyclades

### The Good News
Late April is one of the best times to sail these islands:
- **Wind:** Average windspeed ~10 knots (19 kph) in the Naxos/Paros area. Variable direction, not locked into the summer meltemi pattern. Calmer than June-September.
- **Meltemi:** The notorious summer northerly (5-7 Beaufort, 17-33 kt) is mainly June-September. In April it occasionally appears briefly but is the exception, not the rule.
- **Temperature:** Air 16-22 C. Pleasant sailing weather, cool mornings and evenings.
- **Sea temperature:** 16-18 C in early-mid April, reaching 18-19 C by late April. Swimmable for the brave, wetsuits recommended for extended snorkeling.
- **Rainfall:** Possible -- 3-5 rain days in April is normal. Brief showers, not sustained. The islands are green and covered in wildflowers (fields of color).
- **Crowds:** Virtually none on these islands. Some may not have opened seasonal restaurants yet (especially Anafi and Sikinos). Confirm in advance.

### The Risks
- **Low-pressure systems:** Atlantic lows occasionally cross the Mediterranean into the Aegean in spring. These bring southerly winds (unusual for the Cyclades) and can last 2-3 days. Monitor forecasts.
- **Southerly swell:** More common in April than summer. Harbors that are fine in the meltemi (north wind) may be exposed to southerlies. Particularly relevant for Karavostasi (Folegandros) and Alopronia (Sikinos).
- **Variable conditions:** Unlike summer's predictable meltemi, April wind can shift direction and strength quickly. Be prepared for motoring days (light/no wind) and for windier-than-expected days.
- **Exposure:** These southern/eastern Cyclades are more exposed than the central islands. Folegandros, Sikinos, and especially Anafi have limited shelter options. The Minor Cyclades (Koufonisia) are better protected from north wind by the large island of Naxos.

### Temperature/Wind Quick Reference (April, Cyclades area)
| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Average wind | ~10 knots / Force 3 |
| Occasional strong days | 20-25 kt / Force 5-6 |
| Prevailing direction | Variable (N/NW tendency) |
| Air temp (day) | 18-22 C |
| Air temp (night) | 12-15 C |
| Sea temp | 16-18 C |
| Rain days | 3-5 per month |
| Daylight | ~13.5 hours |

## Must-Visit vs. Skip-If-Weather-Is-Bad

### MUST VISIT (Do not skip these)
1. **Sifnos** -- Safest harbors on the route (especially Vathy), world-class food, gorgeous villages. The anchor of the trip.
2. **Folegandros** -- The Chora is unmissable. Monitor Karavostasi conditions -- if too rough, Vathy bay on the SW coast is an alternative.
3. **Amorgos** -- Katapola and Aegiali are both well-protected. Kalotiri bay is one of the safest anchorages in the entire Cyclades. The monastery alone justifies the trip.
4. **Koufonisia** -- Sheltered by Naxos from north winds. The harbor has fixed lines and is well-protected. The beaches and water are extraordinary.

### VISIT IF WEATHER ALLOWS
5. **Sikinos** -- Only one proper harbor (Alopronia), which is shallow and can silt up. Agios Georgios anchorage is excellent but a lunch-stop only. If conditions are unsettled, skip and sail directly from Folegandros to Ios.

### SKIP IF WEATHER IS BAD
6. **Anafi** -- The most exposed stop. Single harbor open from SW to E with poor protection. Seldom visited by yachts for good reason. Beautiful and rewarding in calm conditions; miserable and potentially dangerous in anything else.

**Contingency if you skip Anafi:** From Koufonisia, sail to Ios (via Iraklia/Schinoussa for more Small Cyclades exploration) and begin the return leg. This saves a day and 40+ NM of exposed sailing. You can add an extra night in Naxos or Paros instead, or revisit Serifos on the way back.

---

## Difficulty Level: Intermediate-to-Advanced

**Rating: 3.5 out of 5** (for late April specifically; in July-August meltemi season, this route would be 4.5/5)

**Why intermediate-plus:**
- Several harbors have limited yacht space and shallow approaches (Sikinos, Anafi)
- Folegandros' Karavostasi has reef hazards on approach and fierce gusts
- The Koufonisia-to-Anafi passage (40 NM) crosses open water with no intermediate shelter
- Amorgos has narrow channels (Kakopérato channel near Nikouria: minimum 5m depth)
- Return legs from Paros/Naxos to Lavrion can be 40+ NM in open water

**What you need:**
- Confident anchoring skills (stern-to Mediterranean mooring at most stops)
- Ability to read weather forecasts and adjust plans (this route requires flexibility)
- Comfort with 6-8 hour sailing days
- Experience with gusty conditions in the lee of high islands
- Reliable engine for motoring in/out of tight harbors
- GPS chartplotter with updated charts (several anchorages are not well-charted)
- VHF for harbor master communication
- At least 50m of anchor chain (Amorgos Xilokeratidi pier requires it)

**What makes it manageable in late April:**
- Pre-meltemi conditions mean average 10 kt winds vs. summer's 20-30 kt
- 3 built-in rest days provide weather buffer
- Route can be shortened easily (skip Anafi, skip Sikinos)
- Several world-class shelter options (Vathy/Sifnos, Kalotiri/Amorgos, Koufonisia)

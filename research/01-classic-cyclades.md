# Classic Cyclades Sailing Route: April 18 - May 2, 2026 (14 nights)

## Departure Point: LAVRION (recommended over Piraeus)

**Lavrion is the clear winner** for a Cyclades itinerary:
- 14-22 NM to Kea (first stop) vs 40+ NM from Piraeus
- Less congested, calmer harbour
- 35-45 min from Athens airport
- Purpose-built for Cyclades departures -- the entire charter fleet industry is based here
- Piraeus only makes sense if you want to combine with the Saronic Gulf

---

## Day-by-Day Itinerary

This route follows a clockwise loop: south down the western Cyclades, across to the southern/eastern islands, then north back via the central islands. Total: approximately **270-285 NM**.

## Weather Conditions: Late April (Apr 18 - May 2)

### Wind

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Average wind speed** | 9-12 knots (data: SW Aegean/Milos station April avg = 9.0 kn; NE Aegean avg = 10.2 kn) |
| **Typical Beaufort** | **Force 2-4** (light to moderate breeze). Occasional Force 5 possible. |
| **Direction** | Predominantly **North to NW** but variable in April. Southern breezes also common in spring. Sea breezes build in afternoon, die at night. |
| **Meltemi** | NOT active in late April. The Meltemi season starts mid-May at earliest, peaks July-August. You will miss it entirely. |
| **Gales** | Rare in late April but not impossible. Watch forecasts for passing low-pressure systems from the Atlantic/Mediterranean. |
| **Calms** | More common than in summer. Expect some motoring days. |

### Temperature

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Air temperature (daytime high)** | 18-20C (can reach 22-23C on warm days) |
| **Air temperature (nighttime low)** | 13-14C |
| **Water temperature** | 16-17C (cool -- wetsuit needed for extended swimming) |
| **Sunshine** | 8-10 hours per day |
| **Rain** | 3-5 rainy days in the month. Brief showers possible but rare extended rain. |

### Sea State

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| **Wave height** | Typically 0.5-1.0m. Occasionally 1.5m in channels between islands. |
| **Swell** | Minimal -- not a swell-driven area |
| **Currents** | Generally weak, but can accelerate in narrow channels (e.g., between Serifos-Sifnos, Paros-Naxos) |

---

## Specific Late April Considerations

### What is Open

- **Greek Easter 2026 is April 12** -- your trip starts 6 days AFTER Easter. This is excellent timing. Most tourist businesses open around Easter or shortly after.
- **Larger islands** (Paros, Naxos, Santorini, Milos) -- most restaurants, tavernas, and shops will be open by April 18.
- **Smaller islands** (Folegandros, Serifos, Kythnos, Kimolos) -- more limited. Main port tavernas will be open; remote beach bars may not be. Provisioning can be limited on small islands.
- **Tip:** Stock up on provisions in Lavrion, Milos, Paros, and Naxos (the larger supply points).

### Crowds

- **Minimal.** Late April is shoulder season. You will have anchorages to yourself. Santorini will have some tourists but nothing like July/August. Smaller islands will be genuinely quiet.
- Vlichada Marina in Santorini may still have space (full in summer).

### Swimming

- Water at 16-17C is bracing. Short swims are fine for most people, but bring a thin wetsuit or rashguard if you plan extended snorkelling at Kleftiko or Polyaigos.

### Wildflowers

- Late April is the peak wildflower season in the Cyclades. The islands will be green and flowering -- a completely different landscape from the dry brown of summer. Hiking is at its absolute best.

### Provisioning

- Fuel and water available at all major ports (Lavrion, Adamas/Milos, Paros, Naxos, Santorini, Ios).
- Small islands: fill up water tanks before arriving. Serifos, Folegandros, and Kythnos have limited supermarkets.

### Navigation Notes

- Channels between islands can be windier than open sea due to acceleration effects (Venturi).
- Night sailing is straightforward -- islands are well-lit.
- AIS traffic is moderate (ferries run regular schedules; be aware of high-speed catamarans).

# Sporades Islands Sailing Route: Athens Area -- April 18 to May 2 (14 days)

## Why the Sporades Are Different

The Sporades are the anti-Cyclades. Where the Cyclades give you whitewashed, arid, windswept islands, the Sporades are covered in dense pine forests, olive groves, and tall cypresses that run all the way down to the waterline, turning the water turquoise-green. Over 50% of Skopelos island alone is covered in lush pine forest. The archipelago sits in the northwest Aegean, sheltered from the worst of the meltemi winds by the mainland and Evia island, making for significantly calmer sailing conditions.

Key differences from the Cyclades:
- **Green, forested islands** instead of barren, rocky landscapes
- **Calmer winds** -- protected from the meltemi that batters the Cyclades in summer
- **Far fewer tourists** -- no Mykonos/Santorini crowds, even in peak season
- **Mamma Mia connection** -- the original film was shot primarily on Skopelos and Skiathos. The iconic wedding scene chapel (Agios Ioannis Kastri) is on Skopelos's northeast coast, perched on a 100-meter rock with 106 steps carved into it. Kastani Beach on Skopelos's southwest coast was another major filming location
- **Europe's largest marine park** -- the National Marine Park of Alonissos, home to the endangered Mediterranean monk seal
- **Short inter-island distances** -- typically 7-15 NM between stops

## Weather: Late April in the Sporades

| Factor | Conditions |
|--------|------------|
| **Air temperature** | 15-20 C (highs around 20 C by end of April) |
| **Sea temperature** | ~15 C / 59 F -- cold for swimming, wetsuits needed |
| **Wind** | Light and variable, mean ~10 knots. No meltemi yet (that starts June-August) |
| **Rain** | Occasional showers possible, but mostly sunny. April is the transition month |
| **Daylight** | ~13.5 hours |
| **Sailing character** | Gentle, relaxed sailing. Some motor-sailing may be needed on light days |

Late April is shoulder season -- excellent for sailing (uncrowded, comfortable temperatures) but sea swimming will be bracing at best. The Sporades are inherently calmer than the Cyclades even in summer, and in April the winds are lighter still. Expect mainly southerly or variable winds rather than the strong northerlies of summer.

## The Route: Full 14-Day Itinerary

### Getting There: Athens Area to the Sporades via the Evia Channel

The critical question is starting point. Most Sporades charters start from Skiathos or Volos. Starting from Athens (Lavrion or Alimos) requires sailing up the Evia Channel, which adds roughly 3-4 days each way. Here's how the full route works:

---

### PHASE 1: Northbound -- Athens to Skiathos (Days 1-4)

**Day 1: Lavrion/Athens to Eretria or Chalkis approach**
- **Distance:** ~38 NM
- **Sailing time:** 7-8 hours
- **Route:** North through the South Evoikos Gulf, hugging the Evia coastline
- **Anchorage:** Eretria has a small harbor; alternatively Porto Rafti area if departing late
- **Notes:** Calm, protected waters between Evia and the mainland

**Day 2: Eretria to Chalkis (Euripus Channel transit)**
- **Distance:** ~13 NM sailing + Euripus Channel transit
- **Sailing time:** 3-4 hours sailing + evening bridge transit
- **Key hazard: The Euripus Channel at Chalkis** -- This is the famous narrow strait (only 40 meters wide) with tidal currents reaching 6-7 knots and whirlpools. The sliding bridge only opens at night (22:00-04:00) and you MUST register with Port Police between 16:00-20:00 to book a passage slot. They contact you on VHF Ch. 12. Plan to arrive by afternoon, register, and transit that evening
- **Anchorage:** Chalkis harbor (north side) after transit

**Day 3: Chalkis to Orei (North Evia)**
- **Distance:** ~42 NM (via Ormos Amirou or direct)
- **Sailing time:** 7-8 hours
- **Route:** North through the North Evoikos Gulf -- "mainly flat water with plenty of harbours"
- **Possible stops:** Ormos Amirou (24 NM from Politika), Limni, Edipsos (hot springs)
- **Anchorage:** Orei -- well-sheltered harbor with stern-to mooring, electricity (smart card from supermarket), water, restaurants on the waterfront. 9m depth at north mole
- **Highlights:** Edipsos has natural hot springs if you detour; the channel scenery is beautiful with mainland mountains on one side and Evia hills on the other

**Day 4: Orei to Skiathos**
- **Distance:** 20-23 NM
- **Sailing time:** 4-5 hours
- **Route:** Open water crossing from the top of the Evia channel to Skiathos
- **Anchorage:** Skiathos New Port (eastern section, protected from meltemi)
- **Highlights:** First sight of the Sporades. Arrival in Skiathos town

**Phase 1 subtotal: ~115 NM**

---

---

*Then 3 more days back through the Evia Channel to Athens (reverse of Days 1-3).*

---

## The Feasibility Problem

Here is the honest assessment: **14 days is tight for a round trip from Athens.**

The Evia Channel transit is roughly **115 NM each way** (230 NM round trip just for transit), plus the Sporades circuit itself adds another **100-120 NM**. That gives a total of approximately **330-350 NM** for the entire trip.

The Chalkis bridge constraint (night-only transit, must pre-register) costs you an evening each way. You would spend 6-7 of your 14 days just transiting to and from the Sporades, leaving only 7-8 days to actually explore.

### Better Options:

1. **Charter from Skiathos or Volos** -- Most Sporades charters start here. This gives you all 14 days in the islands. Skiathos has an airport with direct connections
2. **One-way charter Lavrion to Skiathos** -- Some companies offer one-way transfers (delivery voyages). You sail north for a week through the Evia Channel (which is beautiful in itself), then fly back from Skiathos
3. **Sail to Volos, leave boat** -- If you own the boat, motor/sail up, leave it in Volos, and take the 3.5-hour car/bus back to Athens. Return later to bring it home
4. **If you must round-trip from Athens:** It is feasible but rushed. The Evia Channel is genuinely beautiful sailing (calm, protected, lovely mainland scenery), so the transit days are not wasted -- just different. Budget 4 days up, 7 days in the Sporades, 3 days back (pushing harder on return)

## Total Nautical Miles

| Segment | Distance |
|---------|----------|
| Lavrion to Eretria | ~38 NM |
| Eretria to Chalkis | ~13 NM |
| Chalkis to Orei | ~42 NM |
| Orei to Skiathos | ~22 NM |
| Sporades circuit (Skiathos-Skopelos-Alonissos-Kyra Panagia-return) | ~100-120 NM |
| Return Skiathos to Lavrion (same route) | ~115 NM |
| **TOTAL ROUND TRIP** | **~330-350 NM** |

If chartering from Skiathos (recommended), the Sporades circuit alone is **~100-120 NM over 14 very relaxed days** with average daily sails of just 8-15 NM and plenty of time to anchor, swim, eat, and explore.

|------|------|----------------|
| **A1 (Core)** | Piperi island + 3 NM radius | **TOTAL NO-GO.** No approach, no passage. Research only |
| **A (other)** | Kyra Panagia, Gioura, Psathoura, Skantzoura | Anchoring in designated bays ONLY. Tickets required. No going ashore on beaches |
| **B** | Alonissos and surrounding waters | Normal sailing, some restrictions on anchoring near seal caves |

### Rules for Zone A:
- **Tickets required:** EUR 33.50/day per vessel + EUR 5.50/day per person
- Purchase via official platform: alonissos-tickets.necca.gov.gr
- **Anchoring ONLY in designated bays:** Planitis Bay and Agios Petros (Kyra Panagia), Mandraki (Psathoura), Limani (Skantzoura)
- Daylight-only access in A7 sub-zone; 24-hour access in B sub-zone
- Approaching caves where seals or birds nest is strictly forbidden
- All fishing prohibited
- No disturbance of marine life

### Piperi Island:
- Hosts the most important monk seal breeding refuges
- Only scientific researchers with government permits from NECCA may approach within 3 NM
- This is non-negotiable -- Greek Coast Guard patrols the area
